            <i>Creation of the Elder Dragons</i>
          </h5>
          <hr />
          <p>
            There exists three castes of dragons, by the fetus of creation
            wielded by the God King. The immortal children, who are the Acolyte
            of Umbrae (Shadow), the Acolyte of Penumbra, and the Acolyte of
            Antumbrae (Light), though powerful with the granted tools of
            creation by the God King himself, the laws of creation put in place
            by the God King restricts their power to freely travel from planar
            to planar. Only the Elder dragons, created for this sole purpose to
            serve as the farriers and companions of the Acolytes, created in
            their image, were gifted with such abilities as to travel from plane
            to plane. In a way, the Elder dragons can be considered on par with
            the three immortal children.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The initial caste of dragon, is the Elder Dragon God, the Immortal
            God Kings first companion. The Elder Dragon God was tangible,
            palpable, real, during pre-conception, just as the God King- within
            the chaos realm during the times of creations pre-conception. The
            Immortal God King came to be introduced to Protomartyr,
            contaminating thought and creation into the corporeal entity that
            was the Elder Dragon God, which resulted in an evolution of somatic
            mind, magic, and the vitality of flesh that is protomartyr, the only
            soul-meld of the God King.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The second caste of dragons are the dragons created as the original
            companions of the Immortal Acolytes. They have the power to create
            but much more limited than their masters (the immortal acolytes have
            the power to create life, the Elder dragons do not, only the power
            to create material) and have the ability to freely pass between the
            planar dimensions at will. The Elder Dragons are both equally
            present in the past and future, as time is not linear, but a fractal
            enigma, meaning that their conception of thought is very much
            foreign to any being beneath themselves.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The third caste of dragons is a bastardized version of the elder
            dragons. Created by the Immortal Acolytes themselves, typical
            dragons do not share the power of creation (Only the Immortal God
            King can grant such powers), nor the power to transfer from plane to
            plane. This makes them the lowest entities of the dragon hierarchy.

          <h3 className="courierNewFont">Umbra</h3>
          <h5 className="courierNewFont">
            <i>Acolyte of Umbrae's, Elder Dragon</i>
          </h5>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Umbra, was dubbed their name by the Dragonborn for the
            characteristics of the dark. The relationship between Umbrae and
            Umbra is beyond intimate and believed to be a taboo of romance.
            While the elder dragons were originally created for the purpose of
            balance and conscience their relationship progressed into something
            more. Umbrae initiated the first sin of greed and as such desired
            what was deemed to be impossible to have. Not only is Umbra an
            extension of Umbrae but also believed by themselves to be the
            completion of the whole, the ultimate amalgamation of an immortal
            because truly they are one.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Like other Elder Dragon + Acolyte relationships, the two strongly
            rely on each other for company due to the Soul-Meld of their
            conscience and soul, however the melding of these souls brought
            forth the deepest desires of lust and greed. A corruption created
            from the sin that Umbrae committed during the time of Emergence, the
            genesis of the Land Soaked in Blood.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In present time Umbra, the Elder Dragon of Shadow ferries souls of
            the dead from the physical plane to Hell. Whilst in hell Umbra can
            be seen residing next to Umbrae in the Obsidian Citadel. Unlike the
            other Elder Dragons, Umbra does not have a temple in the physical
            plane as once their task is finished they yearn to return back to
            their better half. Umbra can be seen as a being without patience,
            their true desires being their one and only motivation to be with
            their better half. Hell is currently still a barren wasteland,
            Umbrae and Umbra while in Hell - they create within the plane
            building infrastructure, armies, and the establishment of an
            unrivaled empire.

          <h3 className="courierNewFont">Atom</h3>
          <h5 className="courierNewFont">
            <i>Acolyte of Penumbra's, Elder Dragon</i>
          </h5>

          <p>
            Atom, despite their name, was deemed Atom by the Dragonborn for the
            morals of their fundamentals. The relationship between Atom and
            Penumbra is intimate, supportive, however not immune to doubt and
            confusion. Both Atom and Penumbra are logical and often busy
            themselves with debates on reason and morals. Sometimes these morals
            collide however, resulting in argumentation and intense or heated
            debate.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Like other Elder Dragon + Acolyte relationships, the two strongly
            rely on each other for company due to Soul-Meld, the meld of their
            conscience and soul. The two also view each other as equals in the
            line of debate and thought, making the battlefield of said thought
            and mind even.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In current age, the Elder Dragon Atom devotes its time to the Halls
            of Parun, within the centre of the Bokor States. Within these halls,
            Atom delegates only wisdom albeit to a very limited capacity to the
            most privileged of Dragonborn scholars and commissioners. In their
            spare time, they investigate and venture the realms in search for
            Penumbra, who had gone missing as a result of the Days of Judgement.
            Specifically, the proto-realm, which Atom believes Penumbra
            aimlessly travels and wanders lost, awaiting for Penumbra. This long
            division between dragon and acolyte, has resulted in personal
            paralysis, despondency, and stagnation within the world.

          <h3 className="courierNewFont">Sol</h3>
          <h5 className="courierNewFont">
            <i>Acolyte of Antumbrae's, Elder Dragon</i>
          </h5>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Sol and Antumbrae can be seen as the most differentiated of the
            Acolyte, Elder Dragonic relationships. Antumbrae and Sol follow a
            matriarchy ranking system, where Antumbrae calls the shots, and Sol
            typically follows their lead or counsels. They are not as intimate
            as the other two Acolytes and elder dragons. In fact, the two handle
            work with the utmost of seriousness and focus. Sol, the Dragon of
            Antumbrae, submits to this strict ranking system, knowing well
            within their head that Antumbrae wields more power in creation
            itself as an Acolyte.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Despite what could be considered a tension between the two, this
            ranking structure is often accepted as the logical law of their
            creation. They are bound to the genesis of their intended
            relationship, which was fabricated at the hands of Proto-Martyr and
            the God King. Sol is lawful, and follows the lead of Antumbrae with
            a rewarding loyalty in the image of the Proto-Martyr. They are a
            justicar in personality, strict and formidable, yet merciful and
            soft spoken to Antumbrae.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Sol can be found within the Draco Temple of the Dragon Ascendancy
            once every year to check in on the plane's tangible condition in
            regards to the proto-realms influence. Little else garners the
            interest of this elder dragon. All other times, Sol is tasked by
            Antumbrae to venture between planar dimensions, investigating the
            dimensions themselves, constructing, and serving as the ferriers of
            transported souls of the blessed or favored.
