            <i>The Story of Genesis</i>
          </h5>

            Emergence. The genesis of all things physical and conscious. This
            interlink of thought and matter brought about the god like
            gatekeepers of ancient Sanguinum. The first to be conscious was god.
            And with their millennia of understanding they birthed their
            earliest acolytes. It was the deity of vitality who first brought
            about all things of this contorted plane of chaos and
            pre-conception. The fetus of creation. A blank canvas in fertility.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The motivation behind creation for the deity of vitality was neither
            knowledge, nor power, but experience. To understand wisdom and
            awareness through the eyes of their creation. For the God of
            Vitality was not all knowing, but the most knowing. Being god is a
            cruel role of responsibility. How does a god grow? The Immortal God
            King of Vitality, the first conscious being of the plane of
            sanguinum, believed that it was through their children that they
            would be able to grow. Unfortunately, this included both the
            suffering and exultation of emotions through their children. God was
            neither good nor were they bad.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            What seems to be cruelty, was merely trials and tribulations. All
            things served a purpose, and the Immortal God Kings purpose was to
            search for their own.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The Immortal God King created their first Acolytes, these acolytes
            were considered to be their three children. The first to house the
            order of light, the second to house the order of shadow, and the
            third to house the order of both all things light and all things
            dark. Henceforth these children were dubbed the “Immortal Three”.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The Immortal Three spread out into the lands and created nations of
            their own, in their own image. After a while their nations became
            somewhat representative of themselves. The Immortal God King stepped
            away from leading the physical plane and through their omnipotence
            watched their children rule. After a while the children grew greedy,
            desiring that of what they could not have, and so they began taking
            it by force. They quickly conquered all of the known world, mortal
            nations fell beneath their legions, and from the ashes of the razed
            settlements and smoldering corpses, they erected an empire that none
            could challenge. For many years the known world thrived under the
            tyrannical rule of the immortal three, freedom was lost but progress
            was gained. After a while the child that housed the dark grew angry
            and cold, succumbing to their desires before lashing out at their
            other siblings. Civil war erupted and siblings turned on one
            another, each claiming their own regions and conquering portions
            from the others. The Immortal God King still sat on his throne away
            from the bloodshed, he let it be and so it was.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The civil war continued on and was forever remembered as “the Days
            of Judgement”. The child of darkness sought and eventually crafted a
            weapon they would be able to use on their siblings and kill them. A
            sword was created with a hilt crafted from the deepest metals, found
            only near the core of their world, its blade made from the bones of
            the eldest dragon, and finally it was adorned with a ruby that was
            bathed in the blood of a thousand enemies. After the sword's
            completion, the child of dark marched their army to the child of
            lights gates and then proceeded to challenge them in a duel. Then
            they fought, the fight while not one sided per-se was very much in
            favor of the child of darkness. With the fight looking grim for the
            child of light, the child of dark brought down their final blow,
            attempting to slay their sibling, but rather than striking the child
            of light and ending their life, the child that housed both
            sacrificed themself to save the child of light. As the sword buried
            into their chest, their eyes glistened of silver, soon after blood
            began to drip from their eyes, the sky grew dark and a rain of blood
            washed over the land. The ruby in the sword turned white and the
            sword fell apart. The child of that housed both, slowly turned to
            ash before fading away.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            After the fall of one of three immortal children the immortal god
            king banished his children to different planes parallel with their
            own word. The child of light ascended to the heavens to harbor the
            souls of the good, and the child of dark descended to hell where
            they would oversee the souls of the damned. After a time the
            Immortal God King created more children this time with only a
            fraction of his power and while immortal ensured that without their
            fill their power would be limited and they would have to slumber for
            many years before being able to continue their immortal journey.
            Stricken with grief from the loss of one of his original children,
            the immortal god king went into a deep slumber in his castle to
            never awaken again. His new children would rule the land in his
            absence and would rotate their rule by needing to slumber every
            hundred years.

          <p>
            No one knows what happened to the Immortal Lineage, some say they
            still rule and some say they died out long ago, maybe it is just a
            myth of creation and so ended the genesis of the immortals.
