            <br />
            Umbrae, freshly exiled to hell walks its emblazoned ash wasteland
            pondering. Shook to her core and angered for being shunned, walked
            as she thought - then she spoke.
            <br />
            <br />
            <i>
              “My father, he who hath damned me to this exile, does not know
              that his transgressions of my creation are the very evil that lies
              within him. To punish me for what I am is symbolic to his
              conflicted nature. I am not a failure - the failure is him who
              breathed life into me. I am but his creation and acted within the
              rules he wrote but - now that I am shunned - locked away in this
              exile, I will seek my vengeance. The strong conquer, and know
              this, I am powerful. Locking me away only shows that and I will
              return the favor by damning you to this wasteland. I am the warden
              of the damned and damned - will - be upon you!”
            </i>
            <br />
            <br />
            She screams her inner monologue at the absence of a sky above. The
            lifeless hellscape begins to mold at the tremble of her power.
            Mountains erupt rushing toward the void above, and a citadel made of
            obsidian appears, Umbrae then walks towards this citadel, admiring
            its daunting malevolence and seats herself upon the blackened
            throne.
            <br />
            <br />
            She utters a single phrase as she sits.
            <br />
            <br />
            <i>
              “Henceforth from my prison I await, ready to arise from my exile
              and take what is mine.”
            </i>
            <br />
            <br />
            Continuing on she harnesses the power of creation and calls forth a
            new being from her seance.
            <br />
            <br />
            <i>
              “I breathe life unto the herald of sin, my own creation, my
              legionare to lead an army. Dubbed in my name ‘Sin conqueror of
              Mortals, Commander of the Damned.’ ”
            </i>
            <br />
            <br />
            Beneath her throne from the fabric of her creation rose the deity
            she created. Their body chiseled like a warrior, their skin stained
            of ash, their eyes emblazoned with hellfire, they rested kneeling to
            their new queen.
            <br />
            <br />
            <i>
              “My lady, I am thankful for your call, I kneel here humbly
              awaiting your command.”
            </i>
            <br />
            <br />
            Leaned back in her throne, her hand rests her head, she utters her
            command, short but not without weight.
            <br />
            <br />
            <i>
              “I task you - Sin, Conqueror of Mortals, Commander of the Damned -
              to create an army of the damned. You will train them to be
              ruthless, I expect no regard for life, no holds to their previous
              humanity. Search for your new soldiers Sin, and I shall dub the
              worthy recruits as Hellknights, Oathbreakers of their Immortal God
              King, and from there they will swear their allegiance only to me,
              their new God… Now go!”
            </i>
            <br />
            <br />
            Sin responds with a stoic and respectable voice.
            <br />
            <br />
            <i>“Very well… My queen.”</i>
            Then he vanishes, tasked with creating a new legion of Hellknights.
            Umbrae forges a devilish smile as she looks up to the void, almost
            as if she knew her father was watching.
